Why does the traffic have to yeild turnning right at the intersection at Paul\'s Place hot dog resturant in Rocky Point and at the intersection when turnning at the entrance of 408 ramp of I 40 East in Castle Hayne? This is very confusing to driver\'s that dosen\'t know to turn left in front of the other traffic turnning right. I was just wandering.,"A representative of N.C. Department of Transportation in Wilmingtonacknowledged the intersections can be confusing, and are being studiedfor possible changes. ÒWe have actually been reviewing that ourselves to see if we canchange that traffic pattern,Ó said Joe Chance, deputy division trafficengineer for Division 3, which emcompasses Brunswick, Duplin, NewHanover, Onslow, Pender and Sampson. Chance said the reason behind it is to allow a safer turn for thosein the left-turn lane, and to give those vehicles an opportunity toturn. ÒItÕs ultimately set up for a safer movement and to allow thatleft-turn traffic to move and not back up.Ó In Pender County at PaulÕs Place, southbound U.S. 117 traffic turningright onto N.C. 133 has to yield to the U.S. 117 traffic in thenorthbound lane turning left onto N.C. 133. Chance said if there weren't a yield sign at that signalizedintersection, then the traffic turning left onto N.C. 133 would alwayshave an opposing vehicle in its path. ÒThe only solution is to make the left-turn a protected movement,Ó hesaid, by adding a left-turn arrow to the signal. In that scenario,drivers could only turn left with the arrow. The downside would bethat changes to the timing at the signal could potentially cause abackup of traffic waiting for the green turn arrow. Chance said Castle Hayne 408 ramp of I-40 east in New Hanover Countyhas a similar traffic pattern, although it doesnÕt have a trafficsignal. Holly Shelter Road traffic heading east in the right-turn lane at theramp yields to traffic in the opposite direction turning left onto theramp. It needs to be studied first before that yield could beeliminated though. ÒWeÕre looking for a way to change that, and stillgo by the federal guidelines that we have to follow.Ó Chance said motorists with questions about the intersections cancontact him via email at jchance@ncdot.gov."

A lot of folks would tell me to mind my own business, but it is my business if their driving improperly keeps driving my insurance up.

Just wondering if I need to get my food elsewhere.,"From health reporter Vicky Eckenrode:KC Spangle, general manager of the Chick-fil-A in Monkey Junctionwhere the Americans for ProsperityÕs bus stopped Aug. 7 to organize arally against health care reform, said the restaurant was not pickingsides in the health-care debate.ÒWe do not have an opinion on the issue,Ó he said. ÒWe were approached by the radio station to do a live remotebroadcast from our store, which is something weÕve done in the past,ÓSpangle said, referring to The Big Talker F.M., which broadcast TheMorning Beat with Curtis Wright from the four-hour event that drewhundreds of people opposed to the current health legislation.Spangle said the restaurant has made its parking lot available forother public events with the radio station, such as a coffee with thecandidates for people to meet those running for local office.That said, if you do a little bit of Googling on Chik-fil-A, you'llfind their political leanings do fall closer toward the conservative."

"What is the history of Garver Manufacturing?  What about the president, Mr. Blakeman? his secretary, Louise Walton?","Garver Manufacturing was a prominent maker of sports shirts and othergarments. The factory was located at 1215 S. 13th St. nearMarstellarStreet in Wilmington.  A building permit for the steel and masonry factory was issued bythe city in September 1946. Construction costs were listed as$125,000(in 1946 dollars).  A photo of the interior of the factory, showing employees busy attheir work stations under a network of brightly glowing fluorescentlights, ran in the Morning Star in April 1948.  ÒIt is here that these smartly styledÉexpertly tailored sportshirts were made by Wilmington workersÉunder idea workingconditionsÉamid pleasant surroundings,Ó the photo caption reads.  The plant closed in January 1971. No word on Mr. Blakeman orLouiseWalton. Folks enjoyed working there, according to what formeremployees told Morning Star columnist Celia Rivenbark at a 1996reunion.  ÒThere was something special about GarverÕs, some perfect and rarecombination of caring management and loyal workers that made it aterrific place to work,Ó Rivenbark wrote.  ÒWe were like family,Ó one former worker told her.  No update on Mr. Blakeman or Louise Walton could be located."

"A truck is making a turn in the left turning lane and there is an on coming car with the right of way.  The truck claims he did not see the car, they must have been speeding, they ran a red light and stated they just want to get paid! While reporting the accident to his trucking company.  They had a head on collision.  Who bares the burden of proof as to which car actually has the right of way?

"Why is UNCW looking to cut sports?UNCW is going about sport programs all wrong. They should be expanding. Adding more programs will improve the long term financial health of the university. For example, adding a popular sport like men and women‰Ûªs lacrosse coupled with an aggressive donation campaign targeted past collegiate lacrosse players living in the area could generate the revenue to start a program. In time this could produce funding for a multi-sport athletic complex that would surpass Legion Stadium in quality and functionality. Bring in a renowned coach and the program would skyrocket in popularity. Just look at what has happened at Denver University after hiring Bill Tierney. The program went from nothing to a national power in four years. Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium is a near sellout for every home game. Camps & clinics would be featured all summer long. Wilmington would become a Mecca for lacrosse year round.","Good points.If you would like to post a letter to the editor, here's where youcan do that: http://www.starnewsonline.com/section/letters"

"Why is it that the  Cape Fear Public Utility Authority,is for the most part taking their customers for 55 dollars, for bogus re connection fees, when they have an automated system. With an automated system, how can you give a person a time limit to pay their bill unless you go in and manipulate, the system in their favor for 5 pm. when the day in 24hrs long and you can call in anytime in that twenty four hour period.Which would make the system fix your account as well as mark it as paid for that period. So in actually They are screwing their customers. At least with Duke power you pay a fee but do not get screwed out of 55 dollars. In this day and time every penny counts, especially when your on a fixed income I would like to see this exposed  in print as well as on TV news to see just how many people they have done this to. I paid my bill after 5pm and they came out the next day and shut off my water and want 55 dollars to turn it back on this should be illegal, because some one manipulated, the system to go from 24 hours to a 5 pm cut off but it still took my money.

"On the front page of today\'s paper (11/19) there is a photo of a cross walk looking from Halyburton park. It clearly shows a pedestrian sign installed in the wrong place. This sign belongs on George Anderson warning southbound drives of the up coming crosswalk. There is one installed in the opposite direction.There is no need to warning pedestrians that they are in a crosswalk, they should know that. If you look at the photo, directly across the street and to the left, you will notice the back of a Stop sign warning pedestrians to first stop before proceeding across the street. This Pedestrians sign should be moved to George Anderson and a Stop sign erected in it\'s place. As for the island, it still needs some work to make it more visible. The orange rubber cone doesn\'t cut it. Maybe someone could drive over to Lake Ave, across from Hugh McRae Park and look at what an pedestrian island should look like.

Not only do the human and K-9 law enforcers workthe same shifts - they also share a home. When the sheriff's office gets a dog, usually imported fromCzechoslovakia, Holland and other parts of Europe, officials try tofit the dog with a handler based on personality matches, said 1st Sgt.Tommy Tolley, who leads the K-9 unit. After going through an eight- to 10-week training course, the dogs gohome with their handler to create a bond. The majority of the time, the dogs live with their handlers for theirwhole lives. When the K-9 is about eight or 10 years old and ready forretirement, the handler is given the first option to keep the dog as apet, Tolley said. The K-9s work 12-hour shifts with their handlers and are on call asneeded. They do everything from tracking missing children to sniffingout drugs.They love going to work. They know when you have your uniform on  Tolley said. The sheriff's office has eight patrol dogs and two bloodhounds namedBonnie and Clyde. The bloodhounds, which were donated, are about 3months away from being ready to work. Unlike the other dogs, the bloodhounds are housed and taken care ofat the sheriff's office. For more information as well as bios and pictures of some of thedogs, go tohttp://www.brunswicksheriff.com/Home/Divisions/UniformServices/K9/tabid/671/Default.aspx"

"I just saw on WECT news a report regarding why there is no menorah downtown. There was a lighting on Saturday but it was immediately removed and yet the Christmas tree still stands. The council people feel that the Christmas tree just symbolizes winter and snowmen and apparently don\'t see it as religious. The Christmas tree, aptly named the Christmas tree, is just as religious as a menorah.  I find it offensive that only one religion is celebrated and that so many of our council people were against the menorah remaining downtown and wonder why there is such a lack of support for other religions here in Wilmington.

"My license are suspended for DWI. Providing I have completed my assessment as well as all required classes, I am eligible to have my license restored 5/25/11.  While my license has been suspended I have been driving a less than 50 cc moped.  I had an accident while on the moped.  It was my fault and I was charged with either unsafe movement or reckless driving.  I went to court, pled guilty, paid my court costs and fines and that was the end of that.................or so I thought.I now get a letter from the DMV in raleigh that that was my first moving offense while licence are suppended and now they want to suspend my drivers license for a whole more year to 2012.  If the officer can give me a ticket for wreckless driving, then why didn\'t he not arrest me for DWLR?  I wasn\'t charged with DWLR at all.  I called my dmv here locally and they informed me that obviously dmv did not realize I was driving a moped, not a vehicle! and that this citation would not have any bearing on when my license can be restored.  I called the police dept here and was told the exact same thing.  DMV in raleigh won\'t even allow me to have a hearing about this until the assessment is done. I haven\'t done that because I don\'t have the $ 100.00 right now and my moped is inoperable too.  I am getting copies of the police report and the judgement the judge handed down.  If it does not specify whether it was a moped or a vehicle..............what can I do?  My orignial pink citation the office gave me, just describes the scene, he does not mention the moped.  I have about 25 people that saw the wreck and I can get the ambulance report too.What actually is the law in a situation like this?   there was no alcohol or any other substances involved in this wreck and the police stated that in court, that it was clear I had not been drinking.  the convenience store manager that witnessed the wreck agreed and support that fact as well.thank youdebra tackettI did get injured and taken to the hospital and had surgery on my left thigh.","Hello and thanks for submitting your question on MyReporter.com. I am sorry to hear about your situation.

I am looking for the recipe for brown dog candy.while growing up my family would buy it from a black gentlemen who worked at the Ideal Laundry with my uncle and later from a lady I worked with.

I think it has African American origins but am not certain.  I am almost positive it is a southern thing.  It is made with raw peanuts and some sort of sugar/brown sugar mixture.  The kind I have found and had as a child was in the shape of a circle and supposedly was made in lids of mason jars. I really would love to make my own.

How much money have the homeless meters collected since they were installed?,"Hello and thanks for submitting your question on MyReporter.com. The answer is: Organizers donÕt know yet.The yellow meters have only been in place a few weeks, and the twostaffers with the 10 Year Plan to End Chronic Homelessness and ReduceHomelessness in the Cape Fear Region have not emptied them yet.The black-and-yellow meters, actually repainted parking meters, arebeing installed to reduce panhandling.The first Make a Change meter was installed July 22 in front of theU.S. Post Office on North Front Street.As of Oct. 6, said Dan Ferrell, project manager for the local 10-YearPlan, five meters were installed: at the post office, in front of themain branch of the New Hanover County Public Library, in front of theNew Hanover County Courthouse, by City Hall/Thalian Hall and nearFront StreetÕs Bailey Theater Park.Within a month or so, another five or six will go up at variouslocations downtown identified as hot spots for pandhandling, which isillegal in the downtown area.Officials with the 10 Year Plan encourage people to put quarters inthe meters when they are approached by people asking for Òsparechange.ÓHomeless advocates recommend against giving money to panhandlers.Such donations do little to stop homelessness and the behavior canincrease the stigma against homelessness.ÒNot all panhandlers are homeless and not all homeless arepanhandlers,Ó Ferrell said.He and part-time employee Brandi Tanger work out of offices at UnitedWay of the Cape Fear Area. The 10-Year Plan effort is funded by thecity of Wilmington, New Hanover County and the local United Way.Money deposited in the meters will help agencies that assist thehomeless, Ferrell said.He said a collection will be made sometime in coming weeks and weÕllupdate this question when a figure is available.But Ferrell warns not to expect too much.ÒWe donÕt expect those to be big money-makers,Ó he said. ÒWe do wantthem to be a deterrent to panhandling.Ó"

There is a very strong aromatic smell emmiting from one of the chemical plants here in Wilmington that blow into the Leland area on occassion. This is prevalent in the winter months.

After that, the bidding process will begin.King said he anticipates construction to begin at the end of this yearor in early 2010.The project has been delayed in part due to a shortage in staff inthe cityÕs engineering department, he said.The project includes drainage improvements at that intersection.Plus, when complete, traffic on Pine Grove Drive will continue ontoMasonboro Loop Road, with no stop sign. Masonboro Loop Road traffic,similarly, will be able to continue onto Pine Grove without a stop. Masonboro Sound traffic instead will get the stop sign under the newconfiguration.King said the project would cost about $300,000, with most of thefunding from the DOT."

As a costsaving measure we are moving to an open source phpBB message board forgeneral forums and we are using the article comment function builtinto our main Web system.This switch provided us with an opportunity to improve our articlecommenting system. Unfortunately, instability on our site wastriggered Thursday when we tried to turn on the new system. We areworking with the development team building a new solution with an ETAof Friday, Feb. 12. Comments will not be auto-linked to articles untilthis is ready. Our main focus is stability of the site.ÊFor the entire forum switch we decided on the phpBB forums [link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB] because the functionality and lookof the forums should be extremely similar to the current system. Thelaunch for this portion of the project is scheduled for February 16.Thanks for using MyReporter.com!"

What ever happened with the Clarence Stowers lawsuit against Kohl\'s for the finger-custard incident?,"Hello and thanks for submitting your question on MyReporter.com. Here's your answer, from court reporter Veronica Gonzalez:A Wilmington man who bit down on a severed fingertip when he slurpeddown a mouthful of frozen chocalate custard dismissed his lawsuitagainst Kohl's Frozen Custard on Oct. 23, 2006.Clarence Stowers sued KohlÕs Frozen Custard on College, Inc., KohlÕsFrozen Custard, Inc., and the Carvel Corp. on Sept. 22, 2005 in NewHanover County, claiming those companies were negligent and that hesuffered psychological damage. He claimed they had failed to properlytrain employees and operated a machine without guardrails that hadpreviously severed another employee's finger.The lawsuit stemmed from when Stowers bought a pint of  frozenchocolate custard at the drive-in window of the KohlÕs Frozen Custardoutlet that used to be located at 620 S. College Road. He took it homeand dug in only to discover the severed fingertip.The missing digit belonged to 23-year-old Brandon Fizer, once amanager of the KohlÕs outlet. His right index finger was accidentallyamputated at the first knuckle in a custard-mixing machine. Restaurantemployees looking for the finger to have it reattached werenÕt awareit had already left the property in a freshly-packed pint.Stowers returned to the business about 30 minutes later with thefingertip, but refused to return it.After the incident, Stowers told news media the chunk in the custardlooked like candy, so he put it in his mouth, sucked the custard offand then spit it out. While washing it off in the kitchen sink, henoticed it was a human finger and began screaming. He later retainedan attorney.Thanks for using MyReporter.com!"

"Why is the school system grading scale different in North Carolina than in most states? I have always lived in states where the grading scale is based on 10 points.  I now live in North Carolina which bases it on 7 points.  I have two children, as well as myself going to school and have realized the impact of this on grades.  An 85% in a 10 point system is a mid B while on a 7 point system this grade becomes a C.  I don\'t understand how schools can be compared across the nation for the achievement of their students when the grading isn\'t equal.  I also feel this offers a disadvantage to students as they move from high school to college.  Universities, even here in North Carolina, use the 10 point system.  When they look at grades of applicants this makes a huge difference.

"      First Time Homebuyers Credit is a complete scam. Hardworking Americans lead to believe if they put everything they have into buying a home, that the government will help them. This is what happened to my husband and I. We were renters for many years, knew that eventually we wanted to buy a home just not sure when. With the economy going up and down all the time it had never been the right time. Finally we see the First Time Homebuyers credit! We decided this is it, the perfect time to buy and get something back to help with repairs and other cost that come with being a homeowner. I also found out I was pregnant with our second child, and knew that the money would come in handy for his birth.      We closed in September and not long after had our accountant file the amended return for 2008. We had our accountant do it to make sure all papers and forms were filed correctly. Then the waiting began. In November we received a letter stating that more forms were needed to complete our return. Those forms were done and mailed (certified to be sure) by the next day. Back to waiting again. I called the IRS in December to make sure that the forms we had mailed back were received and this is when I was assured everything was on track. I should have my money by the end of January.     January arrives I call the IRS back to check the status and again I‰Ûªm assured that it will be here no later then February 11th. So now the dates have changed once again. Today I decided to call once again just to see if things were still on for February 11th. This time after being on hold for nearly an hour, and being transferred a few times I‰Ûªm informed they can‰Ûªt verify that I purchased my home? It‰Ûªs going to take another 180 days to contact my mortgage company to get a copy of the title.      I explain that I can give them anything they need to prove I bought this house, but I‰Ûªm informed there‰Ûªs nothing I can do to speed the process along. So 180 days is how long it will take to verify this? Why was I not notified before now that something else was needed to get my money? Why did it take 4 Months to figure out this information? Then to top it off I ask that I‰Ûªve heard you get interest towards your money after the 16 weeks is up. I guess we don‰Ûªt qualify since we filed an amended return?     To top the day off I finally see the commercial on TV where this program has been extended. If there‰Ûªs no money to give back why is the government putting themselves further in debt by promising more people something that will most likely remain a dream for us? I‰Ûªm a hardworking American citizen, I‰Ûªve always paid my taxes on time, and I feel that I deserve what‰Ûªs been promised to me without having to jump thru hoops! I‰Ûªve come to the conclusion that I will not be receiving the money by the birth of my child in April (that‰Ûªs a big let down). I‰Ûªm wondering after this 180 days is up what will they find next to drag this out even longer ?","Hello and thanks for submitting your question on MyReporter.com. We can't offer you legal or financial advice on the details of yoursituation.

"This afternoon my wife and I drove from Myrtle Beach to Carolina Beach to visit with family. We took the Southport-Fort Fisher Ferry rather than drive through Wilmington. When the ferry pulled out into the channel, we saw a ship in the distance, coming toward us (it was moving toward the ocean). When it got closer we could see that it was a container ship and two small boats were near it. One of the small boats was on the ships starboard, toward the stern. The other was on the ships port. A couple of times it zoomed away from the ship then slowed down and poked along for a couple of minutes and then returned to it\'s position on the ships port. When we got closer to the ship the small boat came toward us at a high rate of speed, slowed down, and assumed a position off our port bow between the ferry and the container ship. We were now close enough to see that the small boat was an inflatable/rigid hulled coast guard boat with two large outboards. There were flashing lights above its console. I think they were blue. Between the console and bow was a pedestal with a gun that looked like a machine gun to me. It was manned by a Coast Guardsman. When we had passed the container ship, the Coast Guard boat returned to its station with the ship. Shortly, if left again to do the same thing with a tug boat behind us pulling a dirlect ship hull.Do you have any idea what was going on?","Hello and thanks for submitting your question on MyReporter.com. We weren't able to track down details on the specific incident youdescribe.

"How come the Star News does not cover anything that may embarrass the President. No coverage of Acorn or Van Jones or any of the real radical czars, the march on Washington. I could go on and on. This paper is very one sided you had no trouble going after Geo. Bush. This is why I will not be renewing my subscription when it runs out.  ","Hello and thanks for submitting your question on MyReporter.com. Ihope I can answer your question.I'm sorry you're not renewing your subscription to the StarNews buthonestly, we're criticized by the left for being too conservative andcriticized by the right for being too liberal. There are Republicanswho work here; there are Democrats who work here. The truth, whetheror not you believe it, is we print stories from wire services thatcover the national news: Our reporters don't cover national stories.But we also don't ignore important stories. We did print storiesabout the ACORN controversy, but Obama wasn't president then. He'sonly been president a short time, and has gotten his share of badpress: His health-care overhaul problems have been going on allsummer. I can't remember our local newspaper 'going after'President George W. Bush, but if we ran negative type stories, chancesare he was being criticized and the media was reporting that. News isnews, whether it's bad for liberal or bad for conservatives.Countless newspapers did not investigate the administration's actionsafter 9/11, because many feared being described as 'un-American.'Reporters weren't doing critical stories on the president for yearsafter that horrible event. Many liberals then said we were being toonice to the president. So, I guess it depends on your point of view. Iwould hope that you not turn away from news just because it's not thekind of news you want it to be. I would also ask that you come in andsee how news stories are selected here at your local newspaper. If youthink it's all one-sided I think you'll be surprised at how fair andbalanced your local newspaper is. But again, stories aren't pickedbased on politics. It's based on news. We're not FOX News, butwe're also not MSNBC. In truth, we're very much in between. And givethe new president some time. I'm sure the negative-type stories arebound to come in. Nobody's perfect."

What is the law regarding the burning of leaves.....within the city limits?,"Hello and thanks for submitting your question on MyReporter.com. In Wilmington, residents are not supposed to have yard fires. One of our posts addresses this:According to David Hines, a spokesman for the city fire department, fires are allowable if theyÕre contained and are specifically for cooking purposes. ...Occasionally, people will take advantage of the loophole by burning debris while keeping a pack of hot dogs nearby, Hines said.ÒThat wonÕt work,Ó he said.Ultimately, fire department officials have final say over whether a fire violates the rule. Residents also have the option of applying for a permit, but Hines said the department usually declines to issue them. Fines for fires within city limits start at $100 and increase with each violation.Here's a link to the full post:http://www.myreporter.com/2012/05/what-are-the-rules-for-backyard-campfires-in-new-hanover-county-and-wilmington/Thanks for using MyReporter.com!"

"I live in Stoney Creek Plantation in Brunswick County right pass Snee\'s Farm Subdivision off HWY 17 South. The reason I am writing this letter is find out why you are not forced to Stop for a Regular Stop Signs,when entering into the Subdivision it is a straight road to the New Back part of the Newest Part of the Subdivision I and a fewer residences called the Developer when the last part was built asking him to put up speed bumps so it would slow vehicles down for there are No sidewalks in here and elder people walk the animals and there are alot of children riding bikes and the vehicles they fly though here. The speed limit signs are 15mph mph the developer didn\'t want to put speed bumps down because he said it could tear cars up but he would put regular stop signs up and he did. One neighbor took ap hiself that I didn\'t need to be right in front of its homw I gusess and it was put at the halfway part that had a side street and then come down to where I live and the other stop sign is still up and is a 4-way, but not hardly does anyone stop at it they are still flying though it. I am talking about speeds up to 45 to 55 and sometimes higher just about every morning and afternoon. I called last year to ask the brunseick County Sheriff and also called leland Police if they would please help us out with the speeders and vehicles running the stop signs and the said the were not allow to do anything unless it had a sticker on the back of the signs. They said the Developer Jack Stalks had to turn the roads over to the county and so I called him and he told me that he had done that. I have a  serious problem that when you go to get your Drivers Licenses it is in the Handbook that you are mandatory to stop at all Stop Signs it doesn\'t say anything about stickers on the back of them. I am so afraid that someone is going to seriously get hurt and it could have been avoided. I am sick that we have a lot of law enforcement that live out here and they cannot do anything and plus they run them their own self and we have a few of them are as upset that they are not allow to do something about the issue for the see themselves how fast the vehicles go though here and most of the vehicles belong to home owner that live in here at the back and middle in the subdivision. Can you please help us get the speeders stopped from speeding and running Stop Signs . I still say we need Speed Bumps and if they speed over them and their cars are tore up for them it is their own fault because they know before they do it. Speed bumps have always help a lot in other subdivision slow vehicles way down and it has saved people from getting seriously from getting injury.Please reply back ,also Thank you for your help in this matter,","Hello and thanks for submitting your question on MyReporter.com.

"I agree with your comments about traffic roundabouts last Sunday‰Ûªs paper.  The article prompts me to ask MyReporter.com about the design of the roundabout that is part of the Town Center Drive entrance into Mayfair from Eastwood Road.  There are three traffic circles on the street, the center one being a two-way street!

But I have never seen a roundabout in which the traffic flows in two directions. It seems not only to defeat the purpose of the design, but also to be dangerous.  Fortunately this one is not in a high traffic area.  What\'s the deal?","Hello and thanks for submitting your question on MyReporter.com.

My husband and small dog walked there today, beautiful day but there were trash bags everywhere as if folks didn\'t know they could take them home.  Also, may plastic bottles and cups scattered everywhere.  Perhaps if trash receptacles were placed along the walkway and the boat ramps, folks would clean up after themselves.

The New Hanover County Board of Health(NHCBH) has adopted a local rule that is in conflict with the NC General Statute 130a-39. The adopted rule is causing problems for vendors who sample food items at the Carolina Beach Farmers Market. General Statute 130a-248(a3)(7) clearly states they are exempt from NC Environmental Health Inspection because they are regulated by the NC Department of Agriculture. The NHCBH wants these vendors to pay a $75 fee or they have threatened to close the Farmers Market. If the board is in conflict with the NC General Statute then wouldn\'t the rules be illegal and is this extortion and the actions of the board criminal?

"Will you run this story in the star news?My Girlfriend(Kaitlin Moore)boss stole all of her tools at SolarHair Salon and we pressed charges against him, here is a summary of what happened by kara moore. Please Help us let the public know.  I‰Ûªm going to tell you a little story as to why any local residents of Wilmington, NC should not go to SolarHair Salon.A few weeks ago my littlest sister was offered a job at a really great salon. She weighed the pros and cons, did her research and decided to take the job. It‰Ûªs always difficult to leave one job for another.Before the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, she provided SolarHair with two weeks notice, let them know that she enjoyed working for them but wanted to open some new doors for her career. She came to Maryland to visit with new opportunities in her horizon.Upon returning home, the owner of SolarHair Salon told her that she wouldn‰Ûªt be needed to finish out her two weeks. That her employment with the company was no longer needed. As was suspected, the owner was angry about losing a good stylist. Understood.The following day she went to clean out her station and retrieve her equipment. When entering the building she was asked to leave and not to come back unless escorted by a police officer. Which she did.The owner then proceeded to LIE and say that he ‰ÛÏloaned‰Ûù her all of the equipment she was using. So she went home and retrieved each individual receipt for her equipment and returned yet again with police escort to retrieve her property.The owner still claimed it was ‰ÛÏhis property‰Ûù and at that point the police officer‰Ûªs hands were tied as the property was in his possession. The only legal thing to do now was take the issue to the courts. File criminal charges and sue him in court for the cost.However, in the meantime, her equipment is now GONE. No shears means no haircuts, which means no means of income. No income means bills going unpaid. You get the idea.This man has lied, slandered her name and has stolen.I do NOT take to this kindly.People are going to do what they want. If they want to go and get their hair done at SolarHair Salon, then by all means, do so. But be damn sure I will be letting anyone I know in the area know exactly what kind of place this is, and who the owner is.Shady is as shady does. And this man deserves a swift kick to the sack.  Please Review the blog http://faneffingtastic.tumblr.com/post/13613890455/dont-fuck-with-my-family-truthful-thursday#notes Thank you JoshPlease feel free to contact me 240-338-9205","Hello and thanks for submitting your question on MyReporter.com.

But before  this sport was finished the softball coach at West had already had tryout and made his team. Amazing some of the girls from this same sport made the team that other never got a chance to try out for.  Seems like there are double set of rules depending on who you know.

"The roads in my subdivision, Waterford Place, have deteriorated since they were built and are now littered with potholes.  We contacted the DOT and were first told it was a private road and we, the residents, were responsible for its upkeep.  We did some research and it turns out that the developer took the steps to have the roads taken over by the DOT, but did not give final notice so the process was never completed.  So now the DOT/New Hanover County is saying the residents have to do several thousand dollars in repairs before the road will be taken over and maintained by the DOT.  So my question is this the law in New Hanover County that a developer can just build roads and a subdivision and never have the road taken over by the DOT nor have the subdivision be set up with a homeowners association for the purpose of road upkeep?  When we first started looking into this we were told that in order to build road the developer had to take one of these two steps and they did neither.  Do developers not put down a bond with the state/county and if so, is the county not responsible for ensuring that the developer did what he was supposed to do before they release the bond?  thanks.

"Why does the city (or county) not require it\'s IT department to solicit bids? (Aren\'t mopst departments required to send our  a bid invitation?

I certainly understand the reasoning for doing this, but why not have the College Road stoplight adjusted to allow more cars through the intersection?  It took me over an hour to leave the park on Saturday!  This occurance is not unusual.  It happens all over Wilmington when there are events and concerts.

"How many high level retirees from UNCW have returned to work at 50% of their 6 figure salary plus their retirement pay?This should be the start of an investigation of all the waste and shenanigans that go on at UNCW. Here\'s the policy. These people should be publicly exposed.If you return to employment with an employer that does participate in the Retirement System from which you retired, the following information applies after October 1, 2005: A six-month period during which no service (except as an unpaid bona fide volunteer at a school) is rendered to an employer in the Teachers‰Ûª and State Employees‰Ûª Retirement System (TSERS) must immediately precede a return to employment. A return to work earlier than six months will revoke your retirement benefit retroactively to your retirement date and all benefits paid to you must be repaid to the Retirement System. Establishing a pre-existing agreement for post-retirement employment with an employer in TSERS is prohibited and could cause retroactive revocation of retirement benefits, as well.If you are reemployed by, or otherwise engaged to perform services for, a TSERS-covered employer after six months from your retirement date in a position not eligible for participation in TSERS, you will be subject to earnings restrictions of 50% of your gross 12-month pre-retirement salary (excluding termination payments) or $29,280 (2011 amount), whichever is higher. The dollar figure is adjusted annually according to the Consumer Price Index, which is a national measure of increase in the cost of living from one year to the next. These earnings restrictions apply for the 12 months immediately following retirement and for each calendar year following the year of retirement.","Hello.

This is concerning the question about the gratuity that is added in on your bill.

Are we required to pay what they had on the bill.  We did pay it but not more than that amount.  They would have made more on the tip but it did not seem right the way they did it so they were paid what they stated and not more.  The next time we went we received the worst service we have ever received anywhere before.  And again they put in the required gratuity.  We did not fill this was right.  The service was dreadful.

"As hurricane seesion draws to a peak and knock on wood we have not had any in the recent years but as i notice these major roadways being widened and some intersections with stop lights on poles i think to ask why has the power company not started to put older power lines underground and the same for other utilities.If you look at it would make more sense because if a storm comes through there is less likely a chance of a person losing power and other utilities because not everyone has cell phones and if a line goes down then they have no communciation. I see that they are doing this with new developments but what about the older ones that already have lines why can they not start working on this in small stages. Like i pointed out in the long run it will save the customers and the companies money because a storm comes through they are not having to run out everytime and also it saves the companies when it comes to poles and cars hitting them. You will not have as many objects on the side of the road and it would help reduce the cost on them and the driver cause if they run off the road or lose control of their vechile at least their would be no utility pole to hit unless it was one for a traffice light","Hello.

"Dear Sirs:   I am seeking your help with a matter that is driving our entire neighborhood insane. We live in the Hoods Creek subdivision off Mt. Misery road (Black Chestnut Dr.), and the division consists of approxamitly fifty houses on public roads. The problem is(and has been going on for over a year now)young teenagers with dirt bikes racing up and down the main roads at speeds up to 50 mph from 10AM to 9PM every weekend(also every day when they get home from school).   There are plenty of trails in the vicinity for them to play on,yet they insist on using the public roads here. the authorities have been contacted numerous times and yet nothing has changed(in fact theyare roaring past as I write). Not only is this activity illegal on public roads, the children don\'t even wear helmets, exceed the speed limits(35mph),and exceed noise codes.   It makes one wonder what type of parent would actively engage in letting  their children endanger not only their own lives, but everyone elses who dare drive on our roads.We used to have young families walking with their strollers, now they are afraid to use the very streets they pay taxes for!   Every time the police are called, and dispatched the bikes dissapper into a fenced back yard within 5 minutes then reappear as soon as their gone. Makes one wonder if someone has a police scanner. People are afraid to confront these parents because every time someone has they find broken car and home windows. In short the people of this small community are prisoners to a bunch of bullies who are getting away with whatever they want. I honestly believe the only time Brunswick County will do anything about this will be when one of these 12 year olds runs into a vehicle at 50mph and a life is needlessly lost.  We are all asking for any help you can give us so we may regain our community and our peace of mind.                       Sincerely,                         All the residents of Hoods Creek Community     ","Hello.

Additionally, there are signs posted that cyclists may use the full lane- and this road is HEAVILY used by cyclists.The 35 MPH speed limit is not compatable with neither the serenity of Airlie Road, nor the cyclists.

DirectTV carries MidAtlanticSportsNetwork, which broadcasts both teams\' games, but I, for one, can\'t get DirectTV\'s signal, owing to trees blocking the satellites\' beams. I assume MASN, controlled by Orioles\' owner Peter Angelos, is asking a rate that TimeWarner thinks is too high, and is forcing TimeWarner to black out games by those teams carried by any station in its packages.

Why is no one doing anything about the unsafe driving around Pine Valley Elementary School. The parents are rediculous and set a poor example for their children. They park any way they want and any place they want. They ignore all no parking signs. They enter the bus area where is says do not enter. They park in all directions.They make u turns and block traffic. They drive down sidewalks and almost hit people. They pass buses waiting to enter the drop off area. They drive in the grassy areas almost hitting people walking on the sidewalks. They have no respect for the neighborhood residents or their property. They sit in the residents driveways or constantly use them for their turn around instead of going down the street. They criss cross the roads to illegally park. They speed and ignore the school crossing guard. No one is enforcing the city\'s parking ordinance at all. Every time someone from the city or the school comes out the problem seems less so they don\'t get the full view. Why do so many of them drive? They let their kids off anywhere instead of waiting in the car line. People walking cross the street all over the place instead of using the crosswalks. You need to spend a couple days under cover and see for yourself- it is amazing what some of these people do-they have absolutely no concern for any children or safety.   ,"Hello.

"Can you please explain to me why this new pipeline has been put in cutting through the Masonboro Yacht Club and who is responsible for it being put in? The pilings on the left side of the water, heading out towards the ICW have been removed or cut down. The signs for this pipeline are no help letting you know where exactly it is located. The last time we went out, we were nervously trying to navigate the no wake zone and saw a frayed rope floating just below the surface. It appeared to be attached to something under the water but had no buoy attached to the top. It is very dangerous and could cause a lot of damage to someones propeller if it becomes tangled. I also noticed a number of the channel markers in the ICW are missing. Last year there were quite a few buoys and channel markers whose lights were not working. Again, very dangerous when going at a high rate of speed down the ICW at night especially for those not familiar with the water. Who is in charge of the maintenance for the buoy\'s and channel markers in the ICW? And is anything going to be done about making the Trails End/Masonboro Yacht Club water more navigable?

At the intersection of College Rd. and Wrightsville Ave, heading west away from the beach, traffic gets terribly backed up, and many cars are trying to turn left but are unable to get into the left turn lane because of the double yellow line.

In this case, it seems that the grass property in between the road and the curb is already owned by the DOT (?) and the road is not taking full advantage of its space!  As the university grows and traffic increases, I hate to see Wrightsville remain so congested as it is in some ways, the heart of Wilmington.

"Summer Rest mystery: On April 2 at 6 p.m. the city planning commission will hold a zoning hearing regarding the 200 block of Beech Road, off Summer Rest, which parallels the Intracoastal just north of Eastwood. That block of Beech Road holds a most mysterious building complex. An ugnly eight-foot-high concrete wall runs over 100 yards at its rear beside the Summer Rest bike trail. A large warehouse with 6 truck bays is just south of the wall, with no ID. The property is surrounded with Do Not Enter signs and electric gates at the entries. Two apparently empty residential complexes flank the property\'s southern borders, each also with Do Not Enter signs. What\'s this complex about? What\'s the rezoning about? Is the city considering tearing down the ugly wall? Thanks.","Hello. Here's a link to the answer to your question.http://www.myreporter.com/?p=21147Thanks for using MyReporter.com!"

"I am very pleased that the southern leg of the I140 bypass from 74/76 to Route 17 has finally been completed. However, my concern is regarding the signage heading East on 74/76. There is a sign on the right shoulder indicating that the entrance to the bypass to 17 south is 1/4 mile. The problem is that the sign is almost at the same location as the beginning of the left hand merge lane that takes you to the bypass. There is apparently a left turn allowed at the intersection of 74/76 and the entrance lane. This means that vehicles can enter the bypass either on the left merge lane or directly from 74/76 which seems extremely dangerous.I contacted the NCDOT via email several weeks ago but never received a response. Maybe you can find out what is going on and get some new signage put in place.Thank youGeorge RosicaLeland","Hello.

"Are there any plans by the Department of Transportation to revamp the dangerous turn off of River Road onto Sanders Road? I recommend putting a long turning lane on River Road for those traveling southbound who want to turn onto Sanders Road and taking out the dangerous and confusing median. I also recommend a sign for those coming from the beach who want to turn onto Sanders to use their turn signal.  Presently, those coming from the beach or northbound exit onto Sanders at 55 mph onto a 45 mph road with a subdivision exit shortly after... not to mention 35 mph when school is in at Bellamy. If those traveling northbound even bother to signal that is, making those caught waiting to turn onto Sanders in the dangerous section of road that is in the median not sure when to actually proceed.  If someone is already in the weird little section of the median to turn onto Sanders then those waiting to take their spot risk being hit from behind by the southbound traffic traveling 55 mph around a corner. Also, at night...you really need to know when to turn as the paint of the median does not really help so some further signage would be beneficial.  ","Hello.

Does the fountain located at the northern end of N. Lumina Ave in Wrightsville Beach serve a purpose other than for appearance? The fountain seems to run intermittently and often overflows into the grass and eventually the street. I was curious if this serves a purpose other than for looks. Since it overflows and doesn't seem to recirculate I was thinking it may flush out the end of the water line or maybe provides drinking water for the birds in the area. ,"Hello.

"When local politicians violate state laws, as the mayor and city council did in the Monkey Junction annexation meetings by intentionally not allowing all affected to be heard, what is my remedy as a resident of the city?  Can they be charged, or arrested?  Does the District Attorney or the States Attorney need to be contacted?  What remedy do the citizens have for the violation of these laws, other than elections.  Do I have to file a lawsuit?","Hello. Here's your answer:Of course, the voting booth is always a great way for voters topunish politicians for their actions. It happens all the time.But the remedy or punishment for a violation of the law by the mayorand city council depends on exactly what law you believe was broken.If an elected official took a bribe, for example, that could be acriminal offense and a call to the district attorney might beappropriate. The office of Ben David, district attorney for NewHanover and Pender counties, can be reached at 341-1400. Butviolations of laws such as open meetings or public records laws allhave specific remedies.With regard to the Monkey Junction annexation, the appropriate remedywould be a legal challenge filed in Superior Court.

She wanted it again (though sheÕd never said a word about my finely crafted four-cheese mac in all the years sheÕd been eating it).So I dutifully bought a can and was horrified by the thin pale white sauce, the squiggly pasta, and frankly just the idea of canned macaroni. It did not become a staple in our house!Anyway, I learned by looking online that you are not alone in mourning the loss of that canned mac and cheese. There is even a Facebook fan page dedicated to this classic, which actually goes back a lot further than the 1980s. Franco-American made it until the company was purchased by CampbellÕs.At any rate, from reading the ingredient list on the can I would suggest adding white American cheese to a basic white sauce (2 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons flour, 2 cups milk; cook the flour in the butter, stirring until dissolved, then whisk in the milk and cook over medium heat until thick as you like) and adding a spoonful or so of sugar.As for the pasta, elbows are too short, and bucatini is too long, so IÕd simply use penne and overcook it.Read more here: http://www.miamiherald.com/living/food-drink/cooks-corner/article1972678.html#storylink=cpy"

"How many confirmed cases of H1N1 have there been in New Hanover, Brunswick and Pender Counties?","How many confirmed cases of H1N1 have there been in New Hanover,Brunswick and Pender Counties? There is no way to tell how many people in Southeastern NorthCarolina have had swine flu this year.While it has caused some severe illnesses and even a few fatalities,many people with flu-like symptoms who might have had the H1N1 virushave recovered at home without seeing a doctor.Even those who are getting sick and seeking medical treatment aremore than likely not being checked to see if they actually have theflu strain, which has spread since first circulating nationally in thespring.When the outbreak started initially, public health officials wereattempting to keep counts and sending samples from people withflu-like symptoms to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionand later the state public health lab in Raleigh for testing andconfirmation.Eventually, health officials stopped testing everyone with symptomsto see if they had the virus. One reason was because the number ofsamples became overwhelming for testing sites. Another, according topublic health officials, was that with so many people not visitingtheir doctors, the counts significantly underrepresented how manypeople actually had the H1N1 virus.In September, when federal testing guidelines were updated, the statebegan advising that samples bet tested at the state lab for onlypatients who had to be hospitalized and sent to intensive care.The state also began reporting hospitalizations and deaths of allinfluenza patients not just H1N1 -- though the H1N1 virus makes upnearly all of the flu strains circulating right now.As of Nov. 24, 756 people in North Carolina have been hospitalizedfor flu illnesses, and 66 deaths have been reported.Weekly updates can be found here.(http://www.epi.state.nc.us/epi/gcdc/flu0910.html) The state is no longer breaking down those totals by county."

"So my questions is, Since the NC state clearly states that no offical softball practice may start before 2/13/2013. With this being the start of tryouts, to me this means that any decisions on who will make the team is from the performance of these tryouts or performance of the team the year prior. Not the UNOFFICAL conditioning that has been occurring since Nov 2012. With that being said. Since NO current physical forms collected during the begining of the tryouts, Does that means these aren\'t considered offical practices?  I feel the performance should by based on the school tryouts- not the rec league or any personal knowledge of a friend who knows a friend of a friend and so on.

"I know of a company that uses chemicals for cleaning purposes, while telling their clients and customers that they are biodegradable. I know for a fact and can get proof that they are not. The owner of the establishment also paid cash for work while I and a co-worker worked for him over 2 years. The owner was not paying taxes so he/she would not have to match each employees withdrawals. The owner made it seem as if he/she was doing the work by his/her self. An insurance company that covered the company for a long time dropped him/her when he/she made a mistake and told them about paying in cash. I am in college and am knowledgable in business criteria. I talked to my father who operates the Carolinas for the company he works for and he is a university graduate who knows business more extensively. He knew two and 1/2 years ago when i started and told him i was paid in cash that it was not a good idea and i should call the IRS and report my earnings. The thing is was that i couldn\'t, not on any moral grounds but because i would loose my job and i could not afford that risk at the time. Even now as i type this message i have a an injury on my backside from working a couple days ago and just a little of one of the chemicals soaked through my jeans. He/She does not provide any protective gear what so ever except the recent breathing apparatises that took over two years because of residents who house have flooded and we breathed in toxic smells while working in a room for two hours on some occasions. I only am writing this because i have been mistreated and let go after 2 and 1/2 years of working and helping build this company by my hard work and because my co worker could not got to the places i could becasue of contract regulations. In turn helping the company grow dramatically. I started going to school and everything changed. He/She seemed bitter because at the time I was the man he could count on. It takes months to be able to learn to do the job by yourself and learning to associate with thousands of people with different views. I became fond of the people i went and worked for and over time i created a bond with his/her top clients. Some of whom never bounded with the employees of this company people period but started coming around with me. I was wrongfully done but that isn\'t why i am wirting. I am writing because the people need to know the truth. I am a good person and it isn;t write morally to tell people something that isn\'t true that could harm them. The people also steal from the houses they go into, from elderly women with no one to care for or a single mother struggling to make ends meet, or even a college studetn that doesn;t have a dime to their name. I haver just got to the end and know that this guy is a crook with a nice smile and a white collar and needs to be accountable for the things he/she has done, And if that means I go down as well for not saying anthing sooner then so be it. I think this would be a big way to show people that lying to customers and the government is write but more important to not be dumping thousands of gallons of harmful chemicals on the trees and bushes and grass all over the city.

"We  have all heard the reasons why the Oak Island Town Council has justified the 400% increase in the sewer district fee for vacant or undeveloped lot owners.

Those who own vacant lots are basically paying for a full year\'s worth of monthly sewage payments that those who are using the system pay each month (this is in the council\'s June 2012 minutes).  But the difference is that those who are paying monthly are receiving a service.  Vacant lot owners are not.  So we are paying for a service, but not receiving the service.

All they ever do is fill in the potholes with gravel and seal them. Within a few months or less the potholes are back. This is because of the big trash trucks backing up the street.A: According to the N.C. Department of Transportation, the problem is that it is a single pothole.If the street is full of potholes, the city of Wilmington will resurface the entire road. Because it is a single pothole the city will continue to fill it with a cold mix or hot mix of asphalt.Normally, streets are not resurfaced until a contractor makes a request. However if you would like to report the pothole or request street maintenance, call public services at 910-341-7879.I had asked that question, there are more then 1 pot hole on Myrtle Ave between Dupree Drive and Gaddy Avenue there are between 8 and 12 holes that have been repaired more than once since I have lived here for more then 4 years.

Department of Transportation.  Approximately 30 percent of the students attending Bradley CreekElementary School live in  nearby Greenville Village, which containsabout 250 mobile homes. There is no safe way for the children to walkto the school, so they currently have to be bussed there, Mello says.  Work will proceed on the 3,200-foot sidewalk according to theavailability of contractors.  ÒWeÕre moving this project as fast as feasibly possible and we lookforward to getting it in place,Ó Mello says."

Lamb, who did become good friends many years later.

Generally, we try to focus on matters inSoutheastern North Carolina, and although Mike McIntyre does representthe area, we donÕt have a correspondent in Washington and this is alittle far afield. It is possible to look up McIntyreÕs voting record, but getting anaccurate summary of how it correlates with the rest of Congress wouldbe an undertaking thatÕs beyond our resources.Besides that, this is not as straightforward as it might seem.Only recorded votes can be tracked for individual members ofCongress, but many votes are taken by voice vote and other proceduralvotes in which individual votes arenÕt recorded.A more useful guide to a CongressmanÕs overall voting record is tolook at votes on major legislation, which are available from severalsearchable websites.Project Vote Smart is an independent group that compilesCongressional voting records. You can link to a page with McIntyreÕsvoting record and also a list of rankings from various interest groupswho rated McIntyre's record on their issueshttp://www.votesmart.orgTHOMAS is a website for legislative information that is run by theLibrary of Congresshttp://thomas.loc.gov/ It also includes information on procedures that are followed to steerlegislation through Congress. The THOMAS site also includes a searchable page for the CongressionalRecord, which records results of roll call votes in Congress.I hope this helps."

Many time my family gets together to go out to eat and there always more than 8 people in the group but we each pay separate on our bills. Can the restaurant charge each bill the required gratuity since there are more than 8 people or should they just charge for the bill only of each party and leave the tipping to us? If they charge each of use the 8 or more tip then they are making a whole lot more than if we went with one bill. Each of us always leave a tip anyways but was just wondering. Also if they servers only get paid $2.00 + an hour and depend on tips maybe they should find a different job and not gripe if they don\'t get a tip. They after all chose to be a server.

"On Front Street in the block of the Cotton Exchange, why are there brick semi-circles in the pavement?  Is it historic?","The materials are historic, but the semi-circle design dates from themid-1970s, when the Cotton Exchange property was refurbished.ÒIt is decorative,Ó says Beverly Tetterton, local history librarianwith the New Hanover County Public Library.The urban renewal program of the 1960s resulted in the destructionofmany historic buildings in WilmingtonÕs downtown area. Work was doneto preserve some of the properties that remained. One of those wastheCotton Exchange, which has been in constant use since before theCivilWar.When the building and Front Street were being redone, a supply ofcobblestone, bricks and Belgian block became available asexcavationsunearthed the materials.ÒThey were trying to revitalize downtown after urban renewal. Theyput them there decoratively,Ó Tetterton says. ÒAt that time, therewasa lot of block and brick lying around. It looks beautiful.ÓThe building housing the Cotton Exchange was the home of the CapeFear Flour and Hominy Mill in the mid-1880s. The mill was thelargestof its kind in the South. The structure was rebuilt in 1919-1920 byAlexander Sprunt & Sons to house a cotton export business.Tetterton suggests those who want to know more about the history ofthe building and other departed city landmarks purchase her book,ÒWilmington: Lost But Not Forgotten.Ó It is available at local bookstores and online though purveyors like www.amazon.com"

Go to www.harrellsraceway.net/ and www.coastalplainsraceway.com/. There is Rockingham Speedway, inRichmond County. Go to www.rockinghamracewaypark.com/.

"Why did the Star News omit coverage of the Memorial Day service at Wilmington National Cemetery?  The American Legion ceremony at the New Hanover County memorial in Hugh MacCrae Park and the observance at the battleship USS North Carolina are notable events that deserve coverage but the traditional Memorial Day ceremony at the national cemetery is a hallmark that should not be ignored.  The essence of Memorial Day, known as Decoration Day until 1967, was to honor those who died in defense of the country by decorating their graves.   Wilmington National Cemetery contains the graves of more than 2,000 Americans who died in the Civil War as well as more than 100 local citizens who gave their lives in all the wars since, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  At Wilmington National Cemetery, dozens of scouts and veteran volunteers decorated the more than 5,000 graves with miniature American flags and an avenue of large flags along the cemetery street, hundreds of Wilmingtonians and visitors from out of town attended the ceremony, local leaders spoke, volunteers read aloud the names of the more than 600 veterans who passed away in the last year and a young National Guard Lt. Col. spoke movingly of his comrades who served--and especially those who died--in the war against terror and now rest in the hallowed grounds of Wilmington National Cemetery.  There is no more fitting place to honor those who gave their lives for our country. ","We've covered that ceremony at the National Cemetery many times overthe years, and it's certainly a moving tribute to our fallenveterans. But we made the decision to cover some different events thisyear. We can't be at all of them, so we try to hit the variousceremonies at least every few years."

Dredging can change the textureormakeup of the sediments along a nearby beach. The crabs wouldgenerally stay away from areas with rough shell fragments,especiallyat high tide. He said mole crabs like fine sand because they canextend their antenna up to feed. ÒThey move up and down the beach up and down the tide lines,Ó hesaid. But Fatzinger said he has seen plenty of the crabs locally,includingthe Wrightsville Beach and Fort Fisher areas. ÒI canÕt say their population has declined,Ó he said.

"Back in the late 1800\'s or early 1900\'s; there were several people arrested for manufacturing moon-shine within Wilmington. My wife\'s Grandfather was caught up in it, and I have been trying to find the news paper article. Thanks!","Your best bet is to go to the North Carolina Room at the New HanoverCounty Public Library at Chestnut and Third Streets. They havemicrofilm copies of Wilmington newspapers available for perusal. Butunless you can narrow it down to a specific date, week or maybe monthto look for, it's likely to be a very time consuming search."
"I\'m trying to find more infomastion on some old murder\'s in Wilmington around in 50\'s and after. at Williston school on 11 street.Thanks ","Your best bet is to visit the North Carolina Room at the New HanoverCounty Public Library's Main Branch at Third and Chestnut streets.They have back issues of Wilmington newspapers on microfiche, and youcan browse through them. You'll need to know the dates of themurders, or at least a range, unless you're willing to spend a longtime looking through them."

"Hi,In the past I have posted lots of regular meetings for a support group in town and a few special events. Several years back we were told that in order to be in the StarNews print pages we had to use Zvents.  I\'ve just seen that Zvents.com is closing down, but I haven\'t seen any suggestions about alternate places for us to list our meetings.  Which calendars do you suggest?Is the print edition going to continue to have Support Group listings? What will be your info source?","Zvents is being discontinued in October. We are looking at a serviceto replace it. We believe that any service we adopt will be able toimport listings from Zvents. Please continue to post your events there-- StarNewsOnline.com/Events might be a better URL for the sameservice -- and we'll make sure they get into print. We have no plansto discontinue our support group listings. We're hoping thesubmission process will actually be simpler after the change.Questions? Call Jeff Hidek at 910-343-2371."
